# MineKA
MineKA is a minecraft java PvP/(WIP)PvE bot that runs in Node.

## IMPORTANT:
Mineflayer currently does **NOT** support version 1.13 and up. If you have a server that is backwards-compatible with 1.12.2 or below, open index.js and change line 8 from `version: false` to  `version: <server version>` and save.
